So, Outreachy is officially over and I can't express how much I loved it. Mike was the greatest mentor that I could ask for, super patient and helpful, but at the same let me do what I really wanted to. I will continue working with the Webcompat team, because I really liked the problems and also because there is still a lot of stuff to do regarding functional and unit tests.

I was lucky enough to get an internship that will start on the day after Outreachy ends, so I won't be unemployed for any time at all.

The end of Outreachy also doesn't mean the end of this blog. I really enjoyed sharing my experiences here, it helps me think and review a lot of stuff. I'll try and continue writing everytime that I can or when I get something really cool to share.

That's it for now. 'Till next time.
