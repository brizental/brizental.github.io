Do you ever have a strong opinion about something, but when you voice it in a meeting or
some other forum, you present it in a dismissive tone? I do that a lot. It's very annoying.

The fact is, I am ~~sometimes~~ usually embarassed to have a strong opinion on something I am not sure
is also important to the people I am talking to, so I "play it safe" and present said opinion in a way
where it sounds like I don't care about it that much either.

This can go two ways, either someone shows that they do think what I am saying is important, in
which case I get excited and finally show that I do think what I am saying is important, or no
one seems to care and I get frustrated.

Rationaly, I don't think there is any shame in having a strong opinion about something, even if
no one else shares the same feeling. However in practice... Well, I guess recognizing the issue is
the first step to dealing with it.
