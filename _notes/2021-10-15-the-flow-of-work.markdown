It always happens like this: I get heads down on a bug and I work intensely for a few days or
weeks. Or I start a new project or even a new stage in a project, I get highly motivated and
again, I work intensely for a few weeks or even months.

When I know exactly what I need to do in order to reach a clear goal,
work just flows and it's great.

However, there is usually a period of time in beetween these fast paced times
where I need to plan my next move or I have already everything planned, but it is not something
I already know how to do... and then I procrastinate. And I feel very bad about it.

You might be thinking "Well then it's simple! Just always plan exactly what you need to do and
set clear goals for yourself and you will always be in peak productivity mode!". And I will tell you,
"That is easier said than done and also, do I need to be in peak productivity mode all the time? No!".

The thing is, procrastination is part of my flow of work. Sometimes I am fast paced and crossing off
one item after the other on my tasks list and sometimes I am not. Sometimes I am just tired.

Today I got out of procrastination mode. I started working on a task I was dreading and it turns out
it is actually a fun one! I will enjoy this energy peak and will try to be more accepting once I fall
into procrastination once again.
