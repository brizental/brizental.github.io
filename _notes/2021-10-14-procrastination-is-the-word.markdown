Today I have been in a big procrastination mood. Well,
this whole week I have been in that mood actually.

Let me lay out all my excuses and disclaimers first 1) It's getting cold
2) It's too dark all the time 3) I miss the summer and the spring
4) The heating in my house is broken 4) Oh, and did I mention the cold?

In big procrastination fashion, I decided to do something unrelated to what I should be doing
i.e. doing my usual work tasks or studying German, and I went on to change up my blog a bit so I can
start journaling and writing more.

Inpired by [this](https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-06-08-10:11.html) blog post, which I
read while procrastinating, I will try to write something everyday. For this project, we are aiming
for "quantity over quality".

This is my write up for the day. Please send good vibes that I can get something done tomorrow.
Or at least, that I can write one sentence (minimum) and post it here.
